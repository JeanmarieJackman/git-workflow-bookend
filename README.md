# Bookend: Git Workflow

## Looking Back

Over the past several lessons, we continued building on our Git knowledge
foundation by using techniques to integrate Git more effectively in our
workflow. We learned:

- The primary role of branching
- How to create a branch
- How to add and commit changes
- How to push branches
- Identify local and remote branches
- How to pull branches
- How to merge branches
- How to delete branches
- How to review a repositoryâ€™s history with `git log`
- How to focus on certain changes with `git diff`
- How to unstage changes with `git reset`
- How to revert changes with `git checkout`

As was true when we first learned Git, don't worry if all of these concepts or
actions don't yet come naturally to you or you have to check back with your
[resource guides](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics). The more you work
with them, and the more you see how they make your coding experience easier,
the better they will help you optimize your workflow.

## Looking Ahead

Now that we understand how to work with both local and remote Git repositories,
we're ready to see how Git connects us with others. The primary platform we use
for this is [GitHub](https://github.com). We just took a look at how we can use
GitHub as a portfolio, but the next step is to leverage GitHub to collaborate
with team or community members and share our work with the world.
